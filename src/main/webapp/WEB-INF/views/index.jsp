        <h1>History of Books</h1>
        <p>There were times when people had neither letters nor paper. The history of books is considered to begin with
            a written language when literary works appeared on leaves, clay tablets, bark. Only in the 14th century
            Johan Gutenberg from Germany invented printing with a movable type. Now millions of books are published
            every year.</p>
        <h1>Kinds of Books</h1>
        <p>There are fiction and non-Fiction books. Fiction books are thought up by authors though they can be based on
            true events. Non-Fiction books contain real facts.

            Fiction literature offers a great variety of genres to readers: romance, historical novels, science fiction,
            fantasy, thrillers, fables, fairy-tales, drama, poetry. Non-Fiction includes biographies and
            autobiographies, dictionaries, encyclopedias, almanacs. Every reader has his favourite genre corresponding
            to his taste and character.</p>
        <h1>Why Do People Read?</h1>
        <p>People read books because they are a valuable source of information and knowledge. Studying is one of the
            main reasons why people read books. It is impossible to imagine modern school without books.

            The programme material is contained mostly in textbooks. Reading develops mind and thinking abilities. Books
            consider the eternal questions of life, so they help us in everyday situations and stimulate our
            self-perfection.</p>

        <h1>Quality</h1>
        <p>quality, property, character, attribute mean an intelligible feature by which a thing may be identified.
            quality is a general term applicable to any trait or characteristic whether individual or generic. ⟨material
            with a silky quality⟩ property implies a characteristic that belongs to a thing's essential nature and may
            be used to describe a type or species. ⟨the property of not conducting heat⟩ character applies to a peculiar
            and distinctive quality of a thing or a class. ⟨remarks of an unseemly character⟩ attribute implies a
            quality ascribed to a thing or a being. ⟨the attributes of a military hero⟩</p>
        <h1>Prices</h1>
        <p>A value that will purchase a finite quantity, weight, or other measure of a good or service.
            As the consideration given in exchange for transfer of ownership, price forms the essential basis of
            commercial transactions. It may be fixed by a contract, left to be determined by an agreed upon formula at a
            future date, or discovered or negotiated during the course of dealings between the parties involved.</p>
        <h1>Service</h1>
        <p>A Service is an application component representing either an application's desire to perform a longer-running
            operation while not interacting with the user or to supply functionality for other applications to use. Each
            service class must have a corresponding declaration in its package's AndroidManifest.xml. Services can be
            started with Context.startService() and Context.bindService().</p>
